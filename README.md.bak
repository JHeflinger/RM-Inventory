# RM-Inventory

The inventory system source code for the RHIT Robomasters team. We use it to check in and out equiptment as well as track consumables.

This is implemented on a Raspberry Pi 3, with a permentantly attached barcode scanner. We use a vinyl printer to make our own barcodes to be placed on items we want to track, then any of our members are able to check out parts.

Each student scans their ID to log in, then the barcode of any parts they wish to check out to themselves. To add parts to a robot, a custom ID has been made that gets scanned first, then the process is the same.
